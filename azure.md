1. SQL Server

    Microsoft Azure gives users access to a virtual machine SQL Server. They have a variety of VM locations and sizes to accomodate the user's needs and geographic location. Some features include automated backups, automated patching, flexible licensing, flexible versions, and disaster recovery. Python can be used to access the data that is stored using a package called pyodbc, allowing direct connection to the SQL tables. Pandas could then be used to read a SQL query and turn it in a dataframe in which data can be analyzed.
